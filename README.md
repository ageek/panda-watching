Panda Watching
==============

Watch a panda - the camera moves with your head!

Requires OpenCV and OpenCV Python bindings. Using [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/), I installed these with:
    brew install opencv

Requires Panda3D >= 1.7. Install from here: http://www.panda3d.org/download.php?sdk

(Only tested on OS X 10.8. Likely to require changes for other platforms.)
